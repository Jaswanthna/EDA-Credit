# EDA-Credit
It is challenging for a loan company tob evaluate loan applications and provide loans to customers due to their insufficient or non existent credit history
● This results in two scenarios:
○ Not approving the loan results in a
loss of business to the company if the applicant is likely to repay the loan
○ Approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company, if applicant is not likely to repay the loan
● The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. We aim to identify patterns and the driving factors which indicate if a person is likely to default,which may be used for taking the following actions:
1. Approved the loan application
2. Refused the loan application
The company can utilise this knowledge
for its portfolio and risk assessment
